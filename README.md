# Creadique
Creadique is a platform with a minimalistic design, where people can put their critical ideas,
with the sole purpose of productive growth through communication, much like the purpose of free speech is.

Each User can create posts (critiques) with a word bound, with the ability to put images in there,
with the ability of citation and interactive footnotes, and links. Posts will first be verified to
be appropriate and not contain any illegal stuff. Then after publishing them other users can rate those
critiques (maybe even by several factors), and write comments on them. The creator of the post will get
notified about comments (can be disabled), and the writer of the comments will get notified when someone
reacts on their comments. Based on the overall ratings of the posts of the user, the user will get his
own rating implicitly. The user will be able to follow other users or topics, and in their feed they will
see the posts of their followed users or the posts about the followed topics (with some recommendation
tricks here).
